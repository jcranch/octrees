    Blob Octrees: an efficient data structure for data associated with
    regions in 3D space. Each region must be associated to a reference
    point, which must be unique, and must lie within certain bounds
    (the region need not lie within those bounds). Each region is
    specified in terms of its "extent": a box which bounds it.

    It is very helpful (though not required) if the point's reference
    point is somewhere near that region. In practice, choosing the
    centroid is an excellent option.

    Usage:
        BlobOctree((minx, maxx), (miny, maxy), (minz, maxz))
