octrees
=======

A Python implementation of the octree data structure and supporting
algorithms. We provide two versions:
 * octrees (specialised for point data)
 * blob_octrees (specialised for data associated to regions in space)

Those files have documentation themselves.

To run the test suite, simply run "nosetests". Of course, this
requires that you have nosetests installed!
